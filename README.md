# Getting Started 
To get started with the React App, after installing React and Node.js, you can run/launch the app in a development server by typing 'npm start' in the project directory on the console. This will load the packages and create the application.

## Run the Application
To test the app, you type 'npm test'. This will launch a test run in interactive mode

### Ready to Deploy
Once you complete building the application, the operation 'npm run build' compiles the files together ready to be uploaded and deployed
